## Content Guidelines

### Scientific Accuracy

- All content must be scientifically accurate and up-to-date
- Claims should be supported by references to peer-reviewed literature where appropriate
- When describing experimental methods, include relevant safety considerations

### Writing Style

- Write in clear, concise academic English
- Target an undergraduate physics student audience (3rd-4th year)
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Define specialized terms when first introduced
- Follow SI units and standard physics notation

### Technical Formatting

- Use mystmd syntax for all content
- Mathematical equations should use LaTeX syntax
- Include alt text for all figures and diagrams
- Code examples should be properly formatted and commented
