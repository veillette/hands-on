Their systems and theories strike that ideal balance—complex enough to be meaningful, yet simple enough that students can see the bones of experimental method beneath. The beauty of focusing on experimental principles is that it serves everyone in the room—future physicists certainly, but equally those bound for engineering, medicine, business, or the arts. Everyone benefits from understanding how we know what we claim to know.","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"key":"Q3k4KC5rp6"}],"key":"BK94eH8J7o"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1},"end":{"line":26,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The experimental landscape has transformed dramatically in recent decades.

In fact, understanding these principles may matter more now than ever before. Modern lab setups can create a kind of experimental black box—data flows in, answers flow out, but the phenomena themselves remain hidden behind layers of processing. Without a deep understanding of what happens at each stage, invisible flaws can produce seemingly valid but meaningless results. Surrendering experimental thinking to computers is a perilous path.","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":1},"end":{"line":28,"column":1}},"key":"xhCkFRHL2l"}],"key":"y58jbCkGuU"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":30,"column":1},"end":{"line":30,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The textbook unfolds naturally through this territory.
