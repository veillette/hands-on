# Approach to Laboratory Work\label{ch1}
This book is intended for use in introductory physics laboratories.
It was written, however, in the hope that it would serve a much wider purpose.
It provides an introduction to the study of experimenting in general, irrespective of the area in which the experimenting is carried out.
Some students in an introductory physics laboratory may pursue careers in physics research,
and it is hoped that the book will serve as a suitable introduction to their continued studies.
Many others will pursue careers in completely different areas, perhaps in other sciences, or perhaps in areas outside science altogether.
Whatever the need, the introductory physics laboratory can, if suitably oriented, provide a useful introduction to the fundamental principles that underlie experimenting of any kind.
For our purposes, the word \textit{experimentation} has a very broad definition.
By it, we mean the whole process of identifying a portion of the world around us, obtaining information from it, and interpreting that information.
This definition covers a wide range
of activities -- all the way from the traditional picture of a biologist in a white coat splicing DNA molecules to a manufacturer taking a poll to determine individual preferences in toothpaste.
This book is intended to meet the needs of all who are either engaged in any kind of study of the world around us or who must form a judgment based on scientific statements made by others.

## Nature of Scientific Knowledge
It is natural to ask why everyone, not just practicing scientists, should be familiar with the processes by which we gain knowledge of the world around us.
The answer is found in the extensive part experimenting plays in our lives, whether we are aware of it or not.
Even if we are not practicing scientists ourselves, almost all of us in our daily lives are faced with the requirement to use or to pass judgment on experimental information offered by others.
For example, our professional work may require us to make a choice between competitive bids on equipment having certain specifications, or as members of the general public, we may be called on to form opinions on such issues as the possible health hazards of nuclear power plants, the safety of food additives, the impact of acid rain on the environment, or the influence of national monetary policy on unemployment.
All these issues require us to be familiar with the nature of the processes of scientific experiments and to make decisions that are based on our own, appropriately skeptical assessment of the reliability of the experimental information.

To do this we must first become knowledgeable about the nature of measurement itself.
In specific, we must be clearly aware that measured values cannot be exact.
What we call the \textbf{uncertainty} in the measurement can arise either from limitations of the instruments or from statistical fluctuation
in the quantity being measured.
Whatever the origin of the uncertainty, we must be aware of its existence and know how to estimate it.
Only then can we know how much confidence to place in the measured value.

Once the nature of measurement has been settled, a second and equally significant requirement remains.
Despite all the best efforts of science educators worldwide, much misunderstanding still remains concerning the basic nature of scientific statements.
The misunderstanding commonly centers on
the question of the reliability or authority of the statements.
Attitudes vary all the way from unquestioning faith that some point has been ``scientifically proved'' and so must be infallibly correct to complete skepticism that all science is ``just theories,'' and so can be confidently disregarded.

As can easily be expected, neither extreme position is valid, and public life will be better served if we are all able to take the scientific or technical statements we hear and place them appropriately along the scale of credibility.
To be able to do so, one vital point must be appreciated even before we turn our attention to the mechanical details of the processes by which
the information is obtained.
It is a point that is frequently neglected in public statements about scientific or technical affairs, and yet it is indispensable for their proper comprehension.

The point is this.
There exists an all-important distinction between the portion of the real world that is under discussion (we refer to it as the
\textbf{system} under study) and the ideas and concepts (generally referred to as the \textbf{model}) that we invent in our heads as a consequence of observing the system.
There is usually little difficulty in comprehending the nature and status of the first
of these, the measurements.
However, the second requires some elaboration.
Our purpose in inventing ideas is to represent the observed properties of the system in a kind of shorthand way so that we can talk to each other about the system conveniently, easily, and with a common basis of understanding.
For example, if we were the first people on earth to explore our environment for the first time, we might notice each day a certain type of tree in our wanderings.
But instead of reporting today's sighting and yesterday's sighting separately, and so on for the preceding month, as if each observed event were unrelated, it would be much more convenient to invent, using a certain set of described properties, the abstract concept “banana.” Such a concept would allow us to plan together for tomorrow's dinner much more expeditiously and with a better economy of communication than would be the case without it.
Beyond such simple examples, the use of models is widespread, significant,
and sophisticated.

As we pursue our daily lives, it is easy to forget that many of the items that appear in routine communication concern concepts and ideas and are not genuine statements about the real world.
Often, the distinction is completely irrelevant and we can get away with the careless use of language.
Occasionally, however, the distinction is vital, and serious error can result from
inattention to it.

The danger arises because the two aspects of our knowledge of the external world have a completely different character.
On the one hand, observations that we make on our system belong to the real world and can (subject to the necessary presence of uncertainty that is discussed in Chapter 2) have the status of genuine incontrovertibility.
As an example, no thinking person would question the assertion that we can measure the width of the Atlantic Ocean to be greater than the length of our living room.
With varying degrees of confidence, therefore, all statements about observations of the real world have the potential of being immune against refutation, and this can mislead us by falsely reinforcing the notion that all scientific statements contain incontrovertible truth about the universe.

Unlike statements about measurements, however, statements about our ideas and concepts have no claim whatsoever as absolute knowledge about the universe.
They are nothing more than ideas invented in our heads, and even if they are ideas that have been very carefully chosen to represent the properties of the system as closely as possible, they remain nothing more than just that: ideas in our heads.
Not only must they remain provisional, subject to improvement or replacement if someone comes along with a better idea, but it is impossible for them to qualify, as can observations, as certain knowledge of the external world.

Failure to comprehend the complementary roles of observation and concept in science is very common in public debates about scientific matters and is the source of much confusion.
For example, a famous economist was recently heard to marvel publicly that a drop in interest rates had failed to provide the desired stimulus to the economy.
He neglected to mention that the hoped-for relationship between interest rates and economic activity belonged to his model; the real economy, of course, has ideas of its own.

All statements that come from a scientific study of a system fall into one or other of the categories that have been mentioned.
They may be statements about observations of a system, they may be statements about models, or they may be statements about the relationship between a system and a model.
If we keep these possibilities clearly in mind as we listen to scientific statements and analyze them into these categories, we shall have gone far toward forming accurate judgments.

As far as our own statements on scientific matters are concerned, we should accept the responsibility to be precise about the language we use.
We still hear pronouncements from famous scientists that a ``correct theory'' for something has been found.
They may themselves have a clear understanding
of what they mean, and they do not mislead those of us who know how to decode such conventional language.
But the potential for misunderstanding in non-scientific circles is too serious, and all of us who make scientific statements should watch our language very carefully.

## Role of the Physics Laboratory
But what does all this have to do with possible purposes for the introductory physics laboratory?
Physics teaching laboratories have played such a familiar role that it is natural to wonder how the normal laboratory, with its usual experiments, can be used to provide an introduction to experimenting in general.
The answer lies not so much in the experiments themselves as in the attitude with which we approach them.
This will become clear as our studies of experimental methods proceed, but it may be helpful at this point to illustrate the suggestion by anticipating and outlining the arguments that are discussed in more detail later.
We have already mentioned that our studies on experimental methods will be clarified if we regard the piece of the universe under study as a
\textbf{system}.
By a \textit{system} we mean, in general, any isolated, defined entity that functions in a specific manner.
We assume that we can influence or control the system, and we refer to the methods we have available to do this as
\textbf{inputs}.
We also assume that the system performs some identifiable
function or functions, and we refer to these as \textbf{outputs}.
The various examples that follow will make clear the use of the terminology.
An economist, for example, may view the economy of a country as a system with an extensive set of inputs and a correspondingly varied set of outputs.
The system itself includes the whole productive capacity for goods and services, transportation facilities, supply of raw materials, inhabitants, opportunities for foreign trade, weather, and many other things.
The inputs are those things that can be controlled by us - the money supply, tax rates, government spending, tariffs on imports, and so on.
The outputs are those things that we \textit{cannot} control directly; their magnitudes are determined by the system, not by us.
Outputs
of an economic system, including the gross national product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, external trade balance, and the like.
It would be very comforting and convenient if we could secure the desired values of these outputs by simple manipulation, but we cannot.
No matter how desirable
may be, we cannot instruct the country's gross national product unemployment rate to have a certain value; we are restricted to controlling the inputs.
Even there we have problems.
In a system as complex as a national economy, the linkages between the inputs and the outputs are tangled and indirect.
A change in one input variable will likely have an effect on a number of output variables instead of solely on the single output in which we may be interested.
For example, an attempt to increase the gross national product of a country by reducing taxation rates will possibly be at least partially successful, but the simultaneous effects on other outputs may be equally prominent and not nearly as desirable -- for example, a possible increase in the rate of inflation.
The methods available for handling such situations are sophisticated, but given the complexity of the system, the level of success achieved by politicians and economists shows that substantial room for improvement still remains.

There are other systems that, although still complex, are simple enough for us to control them reasonably successfully.
Consider, for example, an electrical power generating and distribution system.
It, too, is an enormous and complex system.
It has many inputs, such as the number of generators that are started up, the routing of the power through the transmission line the salaries paid to the staff, the hours of work on the shifts, the price changes to the customers per kilowatt-hour, and so forth.
It has obvious outputs, such as the power delivered to various districts, and also other, less tangible outputs, such as the overall efficiency of the system and the reliability of service.
These are quantities that cannot be controlled directly by the management; the system decides their values, and so they must be counted as outputs of the system.

How does all this refer to the introductory physics laboratory?
If we are to prepare people to enter a scientifically literate population, would it not be better to tackle the important problems right away and start deciding whether the mercury content of fish makes it safe to eat or whether our use of fossil fuels is contributing to global warming?
The trouble is that these are extremely difficult problems.
Evidence is hard to obtain and its interpretation is usually uncertain; even the experts themselves disagree, often vigorously and publicly.
It is almost impossible to make a significant contribution to the solution of such complex problems without first developing our skills through using simpler situations.

To see how this can be done, let us think about some of these simpler systems.
An automobile engine is a system that is simple in comparison with any of the earlier examples.
The system includes only the engine, fuel supply, mounting, surrounding atmosphere, and so on.
The inputs may be the obvious controls such as fuel supply, fuel-air ratio, and ignition timing (even though some of our direct control may have been usurped by the computerized systems now found in automobiles, these quantities remain as inputs to the engine itself).
The output as always are the factors whose values are set by the system - for example, the number of rpm, the amount of heat produced, the efficiency of energy conversion, and the composition of the exhaust gases.
This is still a somewhat complex system, but we can begin to see that relatively simple relationships between inputs and outputs can exist.
For example, the input-output relation between accelerator setting and rpm for a gasoline engine is sufficiently direct and predictable for most of us to invoke it daily.
Notice, however, that the system is still sufficiently complex so that the effect of that one input is still not restricted to the single output in which we are interested - rpm.
Other outputs, such as heat produced, composition of exhaust gas, and efficiency, are also affected by the accelerator setting, even if we are generally prepared to ignore the connection.

In the example of the automobile engine, we are beginning to reach the stage at which the system is simple enough for us to start identifying basic principles of experimenting.
Let us go one stage further and consider the example of a simple pendulum.
It, too, is a system but one that includes very little other than the string, the mass at the end of the string, the supporting stand, and the surrounding air.
Furthermore, it has only two immediately obvious inputs—the length of the string and the initial conditions according to which the motion is started.
The outputs, too, are few in number.
Apart from small secondary effects, they include only the frequency of vibration and the amplitude of oscillation.
Last, the connection between the inputs and outputs is relatively direct and reproducible.
Altering the length of the pendulum's string offers few surprises when we measure the frequency of vibration.
Here is a system that is simple enough to allow the basic principles of experimenting to be clearly visible.
If we use it to develop expertise in studying systems and evaluating their outputs, we shall acquire the competence
to tackle later the more important but more complex problems.

This gives us the key to at least some constructive uses of the introductory physics laboratory.
There is real point in working with a pendulum, but only if we view it properly.
If we look at it as ``Just a pendulum,'' our only reaction will be total boredom.
If, however, we view it as a system, just like a supermarket, an electrical power system, or the national economy, but differing from these only in that it is simple enough for us to understand it relatively well, our battered old pendulum supplies an excellent simulation of the problems of the real world.

The introductory physics laboratory, therefore, can offer us the opportunity to practice on simple systems and develop the expertise that we shall require later in the real world with its important but complicated systems.
We must be careful, however, about the ways we practice on these simple systems.
We shall derive only very limited benefit if, for example, we restrict ourselves to sets of instructions that tell us exactly how to do particular experiments.
The range of experimental situations in society is enormous.
In some areas, random fluctuation dominates, as in the biological sciences; in others, measurement may be precise, as in astronomy, but control over the subject matter is limited.
If we are to learn to function independently within this enormous range, it is necessary to identify general principles of experimenting that can be applied later to any future subject matter or type of experimenting.
The remainder of this text is concerned with some of those principles, and we assume henceforth that laboratory experiments will be regarded as exercises to illustrate the principles.

It may now be obvious that many of the traditional procedures in introductory
laboratories are inappropriate for our purpose.
For example, we
must avoid thinking of an experiment as a procedure to reproduce some
“correct” answer, deviation from which makes us “wrong.” Instead, we
should simply assess the properties of our particular system dispassionately
and take the results as they come.
Also, there is no point in seeking some
“procedure” to follow: that is nothing more than asking someone else to tell
us how to do the experiment.
In real life, we rarely find someone waiting to
tell us what to do or what our result should be; our usefulness depends on our ability to make our own decisions about how to handle a situation.
It takes a
great deal of practice and experience to develop confidence in our own decisions
about experiment procedures, and the introductory laboratory is not
too early to start.
We therefore place a great deal of emphasis on experiment
planning, for this is the stage at which much of the skill in experimenting is
needed.
It is important to avoid the temptation to regard preliminary planning
as a waste of time or a distraction from the supposedly more important task
of making the measurements.
Time must be explicitly set aside for adequate
analysis and planning of the experiment before a start is made on the actual
measuring process.

It is also necessary to learn to work within the framework of the available apparatus.
All professional experimenting is subject to limits on resources,
and much of the skill in experimenting lies in optimizing the yield
from these resources, Restrictions on time, too, merely simulate the circumstances
of most actual experimenting.
The apparatus itself is not always good
enough, but this should not be regarded as a defect but as a challenge, for this
aspect as before accurately simulates real life.
Good evaluation of
experimental results always require us to separate the grain of useful measurement
from the chaff of error, uncertainty, and mistaken interpretation.
Experimenters must learn to identify sources of error or uncertainty for
themselves and, if possible, eliminate them or correct for them.
Even with the
greatest care there is always an irreducible residuum of uncertainty, and it is
experimenters’ responsibility to evaluate it accurately.
The ability to cope
with such requirements can be acquired only by actual contact with realistic
working conditions.
It is a common injustice to students in introductory
physics laboratories to provide apparatus that is too carefully adjusted or
manipulated, which can give students the impression that experiments always
give the “right” answer.
This is unfortunate because the foundation of future
expertise lies in learning how to respond constructively to the limitations of
experiments.

The most fruitful use of laboratory time results when the experiments
are accepted as problems that we must solve on our own.
Certainly, errors in
judgment will be made, but students can learn more effectively when they see
the consequences of their decisions through direct, personal experience than
when they rigidly follow some established “correct” procedure.
What is
learned from an experiment is more important than the production of some
supposedly “good” result.
This is not to say that they should be complacently
indifferent to the outcome of the experiment.
Development of experimenting
skills comes about only if the challenge of obtaining the best possible result
in every experiment is taken seriously.

The writing of laboratory reports should be approached in the same constructive
spirit.
In professional life, there is very little point in spending time
and trouble on an experiment unless we can adequately convey the outcome
to others.
We have an obligation to our readers to express ourselves as lucidly, if not elegantly, as possible.
It is wrong to regard this as solely the responsibility
of our local Departments of English.
Report writing in the introductory
science laboratory is an opportunity for exercise in descriptive
composition.
Report writing that degenerates into a mere indication that the
experiment has been performed is little more than a waste of time and a loss
of opportunity for necessary practice.
Report writing at the level suggested
here is almost pointless without adequate review and criticism.
Opportunities
for improvement become much more obvious in hindsight, and such detailed
review should be regarded as an indispensable part of the work in a teaching
laboratory.
