\section*{Preface}
The first edition of this book was written with the conviction that, regardless of the chosen objectives for an introductory physics laboratory, the basic principles of experimenting should not be neglected and could, in fact, become the principal topic.
Introductory laboratories in physics are particularly suited to this purpose since the systems and theories found there are usually simple
enough that the basic characteristics of measurement and experimenting can easily be made visible and understandable. Such an approach to physics laboratory work can, therefore, be beneficial for a wide range of students, not only those who will proceed to professional work in physics.

That purpose on which the 1962 edition was based seems still to be valid.
Many changes have taken place in the practice of experimenting, partly through the introduction of new instrumentation, but mostly because of the revolutionary impact of computing.
Not only can we easily attain a level of
post-experiment data analysis that would have been completely impracticable 30 years ago, but the possibilities for the conduct of the experiment itself have been enormously expanded by the availability of online data analysis and computer-based control of the apparatus.

Revolutionary though such changes have been in the actual conduct of experiments there has, nevertheless, been little or no change in the basic principles underlying the experimenting, and training in these basic principles is still required.
Indeed, emphasis on these basic principles may be even more necessary today than it was 30 years ago on account of the present-day possibility
then an experimenter can be completely insulated from the phenomena under study by an almost impenetrable barrier of data processing equipment and procedures.
Under these circumstances, wholly invisible defects can produce final results with little or no meaning.
Unless we have complete
and clear understanding of all phases of our experiment and data analysis, we turn over our experiment wholly to the computer at our peril.

The plan of the present edition is largely the same as in that first edition but the text has been almost completely rewritten.
Chapter 1 gives an outline of an approach to introductory physics laboratory work that emphasizes the basic nature of experimenting.
Chapters 2, 3, and 4 provide the information On measurement, statistics, and scientific procedures that are needed to understand the basic principles of experiment design.
Chapter 5 treats in a step-by-step way the practical requirements in designing an experiment, and Chapter 6 provides the corresponding procedures for evaluating the results of the experiment after the measurements have been made.
At the end of the
main text, Chapter 7 contains some suggestions for writing laboratory reports.
The main addition to the present edition is material on computer processing of experimental observations.

The appendices contain material which, although desirable in itself, would have interrupted the development within the main text.
This includes mathematical derivation of some of the equations quoted in the main text.
In addition, a sample experiment is described in extensive detail, starting at the beginning of the experiment design, continuing through the conduct of the actual experiment and the evaluation of results, and ending with the final report.
The material in the text has been based on many years of teaching in our First Year Physics Laboratory, and I am grateful to the generations of students whose sometimes painful experience with it provided the opportunity for continued refinement.
I wish to express my appreciation, too, to Mr.
Peter Snell for valuable discussions and review of the text.
