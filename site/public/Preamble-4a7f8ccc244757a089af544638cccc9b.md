This book stems from the belief that fundamental experimental principles deserve central focus in introductory physics laboratories, potentially becoming the primary subject matter. Introductory physics labs offer an ideal environment for this approach because their relatively simple systems and theories make measurement fundamentals and experimental concepts readily accessible. This experimental-principles focus benefits diverse students, not just future physics professionals.

Experimental practices have evolved significantly over time, partially through new instruments but primarily through computing's transformative impact. Today's capabilities include sophisticated post-experiment analysis that was previously impossible, while computer-based apparatus control and real-time data analysis have dramatically expanded experimental possibilities. Despite these practical changes, the underlying experimental principles remain constant and still require proper training.

In fact, understanding these fundamentals may be more critical now than before, as modern equipment can completely separate researchers from the phenomena they study behind layers of data processing systems. Without comprehensive understanding of all experimental and analytical aspects, invisible flaws can produce meaningless results. Relying blindly on computers in experimentation carries significant risks.

The book follows this structure: Chapter 1 introduces an approach to physics labs emphasizing experimental fundamentals. Chapters 2-4 cover essential measurement, statistical, and scientific procedure knowledge needed for experiment design. Chapter 5 presents practical experiment design requirements step-by-step, while Chapter 6 details results evaluation procedures. Chapter 7 provides laboratory report writing guidance. This edition adds material on computerized processing of experimental data. The appendices contain supplementary information, including mathematical derivations and a comprehensive sample experiment that demonstrates the entire process from design through execution to final reporting.
